     The speed of a slider is proportional to projected force:
     @code
     f_parallel = force_vector . direction_of_fiber
     speed = mobility * f_parallel
     abscissa = abscissa + time_step * speed
     @endcode
     
     The mobility has unit of speed per force = um . s^-1 . pN^-1
     
     In principle, the ‘mobility’ is related to the diffusion constant of the molecule
     along the filament lattice by Einstein’s relation: `diffusion = mobility * kT`.
     So measuring the 1D diffusion constant of the molecules bound to a filament
     may provide an estimate of the mobility.

     If this parameter is set, `mobility` is calculated as:
     @code
     mobility = 1.0 / ( stiffness * sim->prop->time_step );
     @endcode
     Corresponding to the maximum mobility possible, since the Hand will
     move in one time-step to the position where the force originates.
     
     The stiffness needs to be set from the link stiffness `S`,
     and considering the mobility of the other link.
     
     Generally you may use:
     -# stiffness = S if the Hand belongs to a Single, or if it is the only Slider in a Couple
     -# stiffness = 2 * S if the Hand is part of a Couple, made of two Slider
     .
     
     By default, this parameter is unset, and `mobility` is used unmodified.
