/// A Hand that move with discrete steps of fixed size along a Fiber
/**
 The Walker moves like a Motor, but it makes discrete jumps along the fiber.
 
 The size of the step size is set by @ref DigitPar digit:step_size.
 The number of steps in one `time_step` is a stochastic integer  
 with a Poisson distribution.
 
 As defined in Hand, detachment increases exponentially with force.

 If @ref DigitPar digit:use_lattice = 1, the Digit will use the Lattice
 associated to the fiber to limit the occupancy of a lattice site to 1:
 - the digit will bind only at an empty lattice site,
 - it will not step into an occupied site,
 - upon binding, the digit will occupy the corresponding site entirely
 .
 
 See Examples and the @ref WalkerPar.
 @ingroup HandGroup 

 Note: Conventional kinesin can make backward steps under heavy load:\n
 Carter, N. & Cross, R. Mechanics of the kinesin step. Nature 435, 308â€“312 (2005).
 According to this, a real kinesin stalls because the probability of making a forward step, 
 which is decreased by load, is equal to the probability of making a backward step. 

 With antagonistic force however, the Walker will stall in a immobile configuration,
 because it can only make forward steps, wereas a stalled kinesin keeps moving
 back-and-forth over a few lattice sites.
 Thus one should be careful when using Walker to model Kinesin.

 @todo handle cases where digit::step_size = INT * fiber:lattice_size
