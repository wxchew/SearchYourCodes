/// A Hand that can eat Fibers at their ends
/**
 The Chewer can bind and unbind from fibers. It will diffuse on the lattice,
 (set by `diffusion`) and it will induce depolymerization at the end of the Fiber.
 To be active in depolymerization, it needs to reach the end by 1D diffusion,
 after binding onto the lattice. It is equally active on both ends.
 The speed of polymer destruction is set by @ref ChewerPar `chewing_speed`.
 
 See Examples and the @ref ChewerPar.
 
 This model is inspired from:

 <b>The kinesin-related protein MCAK is a microtubule depolymerase that forms 
 an ATP-hydrolyzing complex at microtubule ends.</b>\n
