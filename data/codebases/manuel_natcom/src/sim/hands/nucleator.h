/// A Hand that can nucleate a Fiber
/**
 The Nucleator is a Hand, and thus can bind and unbind from fibers,
 but in most cases, however you would want `binding_rate=0`.
 
 A free Nucleator can create new fibers with a prescibed rate.
 The rate, the type of fiber and the characteristics of the fiber are set
 as three values in property @ref NucleatorPar "nucleate".
 
 The parameter @ref NucleatorPar "specificity" allow to constrain
 the direction of the new fiber that is nucleated.
 
 By default the nucleator stays attached at the MINUS_END
 of the fiber that it has created.
 This can be changed by setting: @ref NucleatorPar "hold_end"

 See Examples and the @ref NucleatorPar.
