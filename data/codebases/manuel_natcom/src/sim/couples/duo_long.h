/// A Duo with a non-zero resting length
/**
 The DuoLong is a couple that can be active or inactive:
 - it is activated instantly inside a given space,
 - is is deactivated spontaneously with the given rate.
 .
 See Duo

 The DuoLong differs from Duo in that is uses a non-zero resting length,
 and creates its interaction using Meca:interSideLink()
 
 DuoLong is automatically selected if ( prop:length > 0 )
